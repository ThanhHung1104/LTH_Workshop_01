## Workshop: Building a Real-time Chat Application on AWS with AppSync and Amplify

### **Overview**

In this hands-on lab, you will learn how to build a basic real-time chat application. You will explore how to integrate core AWS services such as **AWS AppSync** (for GraphQL and real-time capabilities), **Amazon DynamoDB** (database), **Amazon Cognito** (user management), and deploy a React frontend using **AWS Amplify Hosting**. The goal is to help you master the fundamental knowledge required for fullstack application development on the AWS Serverless platform.

### **Estimated Cost**

* **Cost:** Approximately **0 USD**
    * *Reason:* The usage of services in this lab is designed to fall within AWS's **Free Tier**. Therefore, you will not incur any significant costs throughout the practice, provided you adhere to the Free Tier limits and remember to clean up resources afterward.

### **Estimated Completion Time**

* **Time:** Approximately **2 - 3 hours**
    * *(Depends on familiarity with AWS Console, React, and Git. This time includes setup, practical exercises, and potential troubleshooting).*
